                  For Nibin Mathew, accessibility is more than just a mission—it’s a driving force behind everything he does. 
                  As a seasoned technologist and accessibility specialist, Nibin harnesses the power of technology to create social 
                  change, breaking down barriers and confronting ableism head-on. His work is shaping a more inclusive world, 
                  where technology serves all, regardless of ability, and no one is left behind.
              </p>
              <p>
                  His passion for sport is equally remarkable. Nibin became the first Indian blind tennis player to win a medal at 
                  the IBSA World Games 2023 in London, securing his place in history at the International Tennis Championship. His journey, 
                  both in the digital world and on the tennis court, reflects his conviction that meaningful change begins with small, 
                  determined actions, paving the way for a brighter, more inclusive future.
