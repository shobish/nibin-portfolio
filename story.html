        <h2>Childhood</h2>
        <p class="mb-0">
          Nibin’s childhood in Wayanad, a beautiful hill station in the southern state of Kerala, India, was much like
          that of other children in his village. His village primarily thrived on coffee farming and cattle rearing.
          Nibin was diagnosed with blindness at the age of two, but he still had partial vision in his early years,
          which he now recalls as a privilege. "I could participate in all activities, though my eyes didn’t function
          the same as others," he says. A lively and energetic child, Nibin found joy in sports and electronic gadgets.
          His home was transformed into a cricket field, where gardens and roads became his playground for hitting sixes
          and boundaries. One defining moment in his childhood occurred when he was playing cricket at home. Alone and
          carefree, he hit a hard rubber ball against the wall, which rebounded and struck his left eye. This marked a
          turning point in his life, as a few days later, he realized his left-eye vision was permanently gone. Despite
          multiple surgeries, doctors could not restore his sight. He still had some vision in his right eye, which
          allowed him to explore his passions further. However, as time passed, his parents restricted him from playing
          cricket or engaging in outdoor activities, which felt like a setback. A few years later, Nibin’s vision in his
          right eye began to deteriorate due to glaucoma, and doctors warned that he might lose his sight entirely. By
          the time he was in the 10th grade, this prediction became a reality. The complete loss of vision was a
          significant transformation for Nibin, forcing him to navigate life with new challenges and the social stigmas
          associated with blindness.

              Even after losing vision in his left eye, Nibin’s passion for science never wavered. He spent countless
              hours conducting science experiments, playing with chemicals, and creating electronic circuits for music
              players and fancy gadgets. Despite frequent electric shocks, he never told his parents and didn’t let these
              incidents deter his curiosity. Nibin aspired to become an engineer, but his limited access to detailed
              designs and electronic components in the available books posed a significant challenge. He often borrowed
              books from the nearest library, but most were in English, a language he didn’t fully understand. His
              attempts to decipher the images and diagrams strained his remaining eyesight. Nevertheless, he actively
              participated in school science exhibitions, showcasing innovative ideas that inspired his classmates. His
              dream was to pursue higher studies in science after completing his 10th grade, but his ambitions were
              curtailed by his school principal. When Nibin applied for science subjects in the 11th and 12th grades, his
              teacher discouraged him, stating, "Nibin, you can’t study science, you must choose humanities." Despite his
              strong desire to follow his passion, he had to settle for a computer commerce stream after a lengthy battle.
              It was a tearful day when he returned home, knowing he could no longer formally pursue his science
              aspirations. Despite this setback, Nibin excelled in his 12th-grade studies, earning impressive scores. He
              made another attempt to pursue computer science at the undergraduate level, approaching several
              institutions. However, he was disqualified because he had not studied science or mathematics in high school.
              His dream of pursuing science seemed to end there, but Nibin found inspiration in a senior student who,
              despite being blind, was developing software. This sparked Nibin’s curiosity once again, reigniting his
              passion for exploration and learning.

              Nibin’s first formal job was with Indian Railways, where he joined as a Junior Clerk cum Typist. The
              exciting part of this role was that it required him to relocate to Mumbai, the bustling business capital of
              India. This happened right after he completed his bachelor’s in arts, marking a new chapter in his life,
              filled with fresh challenges. He started this phase alone, staying in a hostel for visually impaired men,
              commuting daily through the busy suburban railway network, and navigating life in a city where he didn’t
              speak the local language, Hindi. However, the speed and vibrancy of Mumbai inspired him, reigniting his
              passion to pursue his dreams. During this time, he decided to give academics another shot and enrolled for a
              second bachelor’s degree in computer applications through IGNOU, a well-known distance learning university
              in India. He was thrilled at this new opportunity and driven by his strong desire to succeed. Unfortunately,
              his excitement was short-lived. Within a month, he discovered that the institution required all assignments
              and exams to be handwritten, with no allowance for digital submissions. Unable to meet these requirements,
              Nibin had to drop his second attempt at a degree and return to his routine at the office and hostel. Despite
              this setback, Nibin didn’t give up. He continued learning computer programming informally with the help of
              friends who had formal education in computer science. His determination paid off when he came across
              Vision-Aid, a non-profit organization that organized a programming course. Through this, he participated in
              an inclusive hackathon hosted by IIIT Bangalore, a transformative event that changed his trajectory.

              This hackathon was a turning point in Nibin’s life. It led him to pursue a master’s degree in human-Centered
              Digital Design from the prestigious IIIT Bangalore. After earning his degree, he resigned from Indian
              Railways to follow his passion for technology and societal change. He went on to work as a Research
              Associate at the Center for Accessibility in the Global South, a research unit at IIITB. Later, he joined
              Vision Empower, a non-profit organization dedicated to solving challenges faced by children with visual
              impairments, particularly in pursuing STEM subjects through various interventions.
  
              Nibin’s journey into accessibility took off from here. He began his career in digital accessibility,
              focusing on making digital interfaces accessible for people with disabilities. Today, he is a Digital
              Accessibility Specialist at Bosch Global Software Technologies, where he leads an accessibility team,
              working closely with designers and developers to drive inclusivity in technology.

          <h2>Back to Sports</h2>
          <p>
            Although Nibin was banned from sports during his childhood, he eventually found his way back, starting with
            blind cricket—a version of the game designed for visually impaired players, using a ball that produces sound
            as it rolls over the ground. While he enjoyed the game, his focus during that time was more on education and
            prospects. He played a few matches of blind cricket in his state, but the childhood passion for sports didn’t
            fully reignite.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, when Nibin moved to Mumbai, he was introduced to blind tennis, and this sparked his enthusiasm once
            again. The distinctive sound of the ball resonating through the air reignited his love for sports. Blind
            tennis, played on a regular tennis court with minor adjustments and specially designed balls, made the sport
            accessible to visually impaired players.
          </p>
          <blockquote>"I really love this sport; it energizes me," Nibin shared.</blockquote>
          <p>
            When he later moved to Bangalore for his master’s studies, he initially thought he would have to give up on
            tennis, unsure if he would have the opportunity to continue. But to his surprise, IIT Bangalore had a
            wonderful tennis court, and with immense support from the college management, his dreams were reignited his love for sports.

            When he later moved to Bangalore for his master’s studies, he initially thought he would have to give up on tennis, unsure if he would have the opportunity to continue. But to his surprise, IIIT Bangalore had a wonderful tennis court, and with immense support from the college management, his dreams were reignited. The institute even imported dozens of specialized balls from Japan to help him pursue his passion. This support propelled Nibin to become the first national blind tennis champion in India.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the COVID-19 pandemic, Nibin had to return to his hometown, where there were no tennis courts available. Yet, his determination drove him to create his own tennis court, using a well net, and he practiced on a concrete floor near his house with local children. Reflecting on that time, he said, "It was a tough period for the world, but my world was in exploration mode, and I found ways to chase my dreams."
          </p>
          <p>In January 2023, Nibin received exciting news: the IBSA World Games were approaching, and he had the chance to represent India in the  blind tennis championship. As this was his first international participation, he had to navigate everything on his own, from preparation to logistics. The trip to London was quite expensive, but his dream was fueled by a sponsorship from his company, Bosch Global Software Technologies. In his first attempt on the international stage, Nibin achieved an incredible milestone—he secured a bronze medal, marking not only his first international success but also the first blind tennis medal for India.
          </p>
          <p>Now, Nibin is inspiring other visually impaired children to pursue sports alongside their academic pursuits, encouraging them to chase their dreams, just as he did. The very sport that he was once banned from in childhood is now the one that brought him immense pride for his country.</p>
